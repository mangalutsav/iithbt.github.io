From hundreds of years, common people in Arab countries were struggling

with the problems like political corruption, inflation, unemployment, poverty,

human right violations. In the year 2010, the anger against the Government

exploded in Tunisia. Arab Spring was a revolutionary wave of demonstrations

and protests, riots, and civil wars in the middle-east countries. It then spread

like epidemic in the neighbouring countries which were in similar condition.



Starting from Tunisia, this wave spread to almost all other neighbouring

countries. This was first triggered by self-immolation of activist Mohamed

Bouazizi in the Tunisian city Sidi Bouzid. Protests started in whole country

against Government. Finally, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was exiled by

demonstrators and he fled to Saudi Arabia. Egypt, which was facing the similar

problems as Tunisia, was inspired by the uprising in Tunisia. Protests started

against the government. They were strongly suppressed by President Hosni

Mubarak using his power. But protests continued to increase. Finally President

resigned and transferred his powers to Armed Forces. At Tahrir Square, Essam

Sharaf was appointed as Prime Minister of Egypt.



Demonstrations were performed in a similar way in countries like Libya, Syria,

Lebanon, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. In Libya, protests became more violent as

Government tried to oppose protestors using army. After long battles, and

with the help of other countries, activists succeeded in overthrowing the

Government. President Muammar Gaddafi was brutally killed by opposite

forces. In other countries also, Government was ousted and new leaders were

chosen by people.



New concepts of riots were discovered in these civil wars. The special feature

of the Arab Spring was the use of internet services to spread the patriotic wave

among people. Protestors used social media to spread their messages. Due to

this, Egyptian Government restricted the internet access across the entire

nation during civil war.



Though, Arab Springs succeeded in conveying positive message to the rest of

the world, it is so disheartening that the major aims of this revolution were

widely disputed. Â It has also disappointed those hoping that the removal of

corrupt rulers would translate into an instant improvement in living standards

because financial damage caused due to war to these already poor countries

pushed them into serious trouble of poverty and inflation. The attitude of the

government towards this revolution was also shocking. Instead of listening to

the demands of people and coming up with a solution, they tried to smash the

crowd by using their military powers eventually creating war like conditions.

About 170,000 lost their lives in this civil war. Conditions are not normal in

these countries till today.



This movement has disproved the passivity of Arabs towards political issues. It

gave a message to the world, that common people will not tolerate any form

of injustice against them. We can define Arab Spring as a revolutionary

movement done for long term achievements and whose final outcomes are yet

to be known.
