## Our Mission

The group has the sole objective of establishing its roots in IIT Rookee and gradually building it in other IIT's as well. In this way, the information between the IIT's can pass both quickly and effectively. It aims at making all the IITIAN's aware of the events occurring across other IIT's, so that they do not miss out on any activity. Moreover, it also transfers the invaluable message that a prof/alumni has to give to the students which would help them in their future experiences.
